= DroomClient

Notes:

* We're just going to assume that this is happening in an environment that is either core data or a core data client, so the Person class is going to be available one way or another. If not, best avoid calling `user.person`.

* the events api isn't yet set up in droom.

* what should we do about the duplication of HkNames and Settings. It should be ok since they're identical, but not very pleasing. HkNames I guess will disappear from here once all person data is consolidated in core and the user class is just an authentication mechanism.
